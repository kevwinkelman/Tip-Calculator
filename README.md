# Tip-Calculator
A calculator that calculates tips in android for my mobile app development class

For the MainActivity and the TipCalculator classes it was pulled from our book,
The lecture was to explain how views, layouts and styles work.

I learned that you may use styles to easily be tagged within layouts to not be defined for every specific EditText, Button.
You will have to properly align views according to ID tags
